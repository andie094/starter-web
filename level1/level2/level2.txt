The crazy cursing lady
Medium

So I’m back at it again with another story...but today is crazy.

Liquidation sales were going well today so far with very few rude customers, there was this lady who called me rude and said just because we work in customer service doesn’t mean we have to be rude. All I did was direct people to the sign that reads in big letters “line forms here”. I was happy I didn’t have to ring her up.

Later in the day she’s back...I guess she was shopping still because the bras and panties section changed to 70% and she saw it, she goes to the register and demands that her 60% panties and bras get changed to 70%. Of course my coworker was compliant with her...something happened because I heard yelling and cussing.

She calls my coworker a smart ass for some reason then one of my other coworkers directs her to jewelry(my area) to see a manager...here’s the thing, the manager went to eat so I’m alone, the crazy lady recognizes me and calls me out for being rude earlier and I try to tell her that I wasn’t being rude then she tells me to shut up then she walks back to the other register.

My jewelry manager comes back and I direct her to where crazy lady is, shouting and cussing happens because the lady doesn’t like what the manager says. age calls her a smart ass then my manager threatens to call security because the lady just doesn’t want to leave and is making a scene.

It was a crazy moment, I was low key cracking up while helping my customer out...because this lady was acting like a fool.
